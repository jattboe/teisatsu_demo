# Teisatsu

Teisatsu is an advanced cybersecurity tool designed to streamline the process of subdomain and endpoint analysis, catering specifically to vulnerability assessment and penetration testing. It is an essential toolkit for bug bounty hunters, security researchers, and other cybersecurity professionals.

## Overview

Teisatsu performs a comprehensive scan by gathering subdomains and endpoints from 35 different sources. These sources are systematically divided into four distinct buckets, allowing for efficient and methodical scanning.

## Key Components
    
- Subdomain Gathering & DNS Bruteforce Module: Teisatsu simultaneously passes the subdomains to a custom-written DNS bruteforce module, using Golang channels. This module checks the validity of subdomains, saving them in a MongoDB database.

 - Vulnerability Scanner: Upon identifying valid subdomains, they are passed to a vulnerability scanner. This scanner looks for common vulnerabilities such as subdomain takeover, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), etc.

- API Server: Teisatsu comes with an API server that allows users to query saved data from MongoDB, providing robust access to valuable intelligence.

- User Dashboard: A separate user dashboard server has been created using Flask, offering a user-friendly interface to interact with Teisatsu's features.

 - Remote Control via Discord/Telegram Bot: Users can initiate scans remotely from any device through a dedicated Discord/Telegram bot. This bot also provides real-time notifications if any vulnerabilities are found.

 - Additional Features: Teisatsu includes several other functionalities that have proven instrumental in finding vulnerabilities in bug bounty targets.

## Why Teisatsu?
